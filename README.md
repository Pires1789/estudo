## Overview

This is my repository for understand more about Python.
My main goal is to create a easy way of consulting somes function of library for Data Science (like Pandas, NumPy...).

Some of the scrips come from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and [DSA Academy](www.datascienceacademy.com.br) and I'm coding in portuguese.

I hope that is a way to help other student and, off course, to evolve Python Skills :)
